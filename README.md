- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mehrdadanvar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a General Physician interested in population and public health. I found myself going down the rabit whole of programming when I was tired of manipulating patient data in Microsoft Excel. I started using SPSS and STATA mainly for data analysis, but they didnt satisfy me!! I wanted to go deeper
- ðŸŒ± Fortunately or not, my first programminglanguage was R!. although I loved using it, I have found myself gravitating to python, Javascript, vue, docker and managing servers!!!!
