- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mehrdadanvar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a General Physician interested in population and public health. I found myself going down the rabbit hole of programming when I was tired of manipulating patient data in Microsoft Excel. I started using SPSS and STATA mainly for data analysis, but they didn't satisfy me!! I wanted to go deeper
- ðŸŒ± Fortunately or not, my first programming language was R!. although I loved using it, I have found myself gravitating to Python, Javascript, Vue, docker and managing servers!!!!
